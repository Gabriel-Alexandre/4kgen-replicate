The scene features a variety of colorful flowers like tulips, daffodils, and cherry blossoms, with their petals gently scattered on the ground. The background showcases a well-maintained lawn dotted with old oak trees whose leaves are just beginning to unfurl. Soft sunlight filters through the canopy, casting dappled shadows and adding depth to the scene. The colors range from soft pinks and yellows to deeper purples and reds, creating a visually stunning and serene atmosphere. The texture of the grass is finely detailed, as well as the leaves on the trees."
