The sand is slightly dune-shaped, with a few scattered seashells and pebbles. A lone palm tree stands tall, its fronds rustling in the wind. The sky is painted with hues of peach, coral, and lavender, with a few wispy clouds drifting lazily across."

The flowers are a mix of red, pink, and white, with delicate green leaves and intricate, lace-like patterns. The air is filled with the sweet scent of blooming flowers and the soft chirping of birds. The sky above is a brilliant blue, with a few puffy white clouds drifting lazily by."
